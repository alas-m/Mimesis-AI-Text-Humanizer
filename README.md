# Mimesis-AI-Text-Humanizer
Mimesis is an end-to-end NLP pipeline that humanizes AI text using your personal Telegram archives. It uses a Netflix-style UI to transform drafts into three distinct modes: Chatting, Formal, and Academic. By mimicking your specific syntax, burstiness, and "Slavic-English" patterns, it effectively bypasses AI detectors.
